    <p>Spider-Ham is a humorous, anthropomorphic version of Spider-Man from a universe populated by animal versions of superheroes. Peter Porker was once an ordinary spider who was bitten by a radioactive pig, turning him into Spider-Ham. He fights crime in a whimsical, cartoon-like world and his stories are full of slapstick humor. This character parodies both Spider-Man and the animal-centric cartoons of the early 20th century.</p>
