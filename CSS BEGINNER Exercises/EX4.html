    <div>In a controversial storyline, Doctor Octopus (Otto Octavius) swaps bodies with Peter Parker and takes over his life, believing he can be a better, more "superior" Spider-Man. With Peter's memories and abilities, Otto tries to prove that he can be a more efficient hero by using his own intellect and sometimes ruthless tactics. Over time, Otto starts to understand Peter's values, making him a more complex anti-hero. This arc showed a darker, morally ambiguous version of Spider-Man.</div>
