    <p>Jessica Drew is the original Spider-Woman from the main Marvel Universe (Earth-616). She gained her powers after being injected with a special serum and exposed to radiation. Unlike Peter Parker, her abilities include bio-electric "venom blasts," super strength, and enhanced agility. Jessica's character is often involved in espionage and covert operations, and she has been a member of groups like S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers. While her story differs greatly from Spider-Man, she shares his sense of justice and heroism.</p>
