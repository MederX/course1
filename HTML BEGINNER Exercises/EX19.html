        <dt><b>Miles Morales (Earth-1610)</b></dt>
        <dd><br>Miles Morales is a teenager from an alternate universe where he becomes Spider-Man after being bitten by a genetically-altered spider. Unlike Peter Parker, Miles has additional abilities such as camouflage (invisibility) and a venom blast (a bio-electric shock). He first appeared in Marvel's Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man and gained popularity in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. His character is known for being a symbol of diversity and youthful energy, balancing his life as a hero and a regular high school student.</dd>

        <dt><b><br>Spider-Man 2099 (Miguel O'Hara, Earth-928)</b></dt>
        <dd><br>Miguel O'Hara, also known as Spider-Man 2099, is from a dystopian future (the year 2099) where corporations have taken control. A brilliant geneticist, Miguel gains spider-like powers after a failed experiment to recreate the abilities of the original Spider-Man. Unlike Peter Parker, Miguel does not have a "spider-sense," but he has enhanced vision, retractable talons, and organic webbing. His suit is advanced and features a sleek, futuristic design.</dd>

        <dt><b><br>Spider-Man Noir (Peter Parker, Earth-90214)</b></dt>
        <dd><br>Spider-Man Noir is a darker, 1930s version of Spider-Man. In this universe, Peter Parker gains his powers after being bitten by a mystical spider hidden within an ancient relic. His world is set during the Great Depression, and he operates more like a gritty detective, often taking on corrupt politicians and gangsters. Unlike other versions, Spider-Man Noir uses firearms and his costume reflects the noir aesthetic, complete with a trench coat and goggles. His appearance in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse brought the character more into the mainstream.</dd>
